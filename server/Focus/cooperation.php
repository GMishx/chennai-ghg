                                        The corporation spends an estimated 6.5 lakh a day on diesel for transporting garbage.

                                        Studies have shown that burning garbage in Chennai's dump yards at Kodungaiyur and Perungudi poses severe health hazards, even exposing nearby residents to the threat of cancer. Many people living near these dump yards have complained that air polluted by burning garbage has caused respiratory disorders.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        With Kodungaiyur and Perungudi dumpyards moving towards the end of their lifetime, the Che-nnai Corporation is toying with a new strategy to dispose. Our focus is on the percentage emission of GHG in and around the two main dumpyards covering an area of 5kms radius each. It has surely an impact on the climatic change in our city.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We need to work on improving the clearing or in separating and recycling the garbages. A clean sanitary/engineered dumpyard must be built for the betterment of our people.
