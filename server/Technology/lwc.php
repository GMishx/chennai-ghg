                                        Our Government is showing some progress in municipal waste management. However  there are no sanitary dumpyard to be constructed yet. The first one is expected to be constructed in 2015. There is  no proper or organized  systems in place for managing this stream, although some pilot projects involving home composting or the anaerobic digestion of manure, have been initiated. In spite of the many benefits of recovering energy from biogas/biomass or utilising the fertilising properties of composted agricultural waste, the available technologies for exploiting this potential are not being put to use. Recycling contributes to the prevention of GHG emissions by conserving natural resources and reducing the amount of waste for disposal. These schemes cover commercial, and to a lesser extent industrial, non-hazardous waste. Most small, and in rare cases medium-sized, private companies involved in the recycling business cooperate with the informal sector.
