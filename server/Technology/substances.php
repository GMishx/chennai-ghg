                                        Healthcare waste management has an impact on GHG emissions as a result of incineration and/or improper disposal. Some activities are being undertaken to strengthen enforcement and improve healthcare waste separation and treatment. However, the new healthcare waste management system is not sufficient to cover the our need. The appropriate management of special waste streams (oil, tyres, batteries and accumulators, end-offlife vehicles, and electric and electronic waste) may contribute to reducing GHG emissions in the same way as the recycling of other commodities. Large amounts of batteries and accumulators are recycled due to the demand for recovered lead and hard plastics, which is driven by the high price of these commodities on the market. There is insufficient recycling of waste tyres, end-of-life vehicles and electric and electronic equipment, although appropriate provisions have been set in national laws. If the private sector were to become more involved in waste management, and with the appropriate enforcement to improve our city.
