                                        The present study would focus on locating all the municipal solid waste disposal sites including the dump yards within 600 square kilometer area of the Chennai City using GIS and monitoring the amount of GHG from the two major dump yards using CH4- CO2 sensors installed at the hotspots on the dumpyards.

                                        One densely populated area within 5 km distance of Perungudi and Kodungaiyur landfills will be identified as a source of Municipal solid waste generation. Non-spatially varied data like atmospheric gas concentration pressure, temperature, moisture content & temperature of cover soil will be recorded. Ten hotspots on each of the disposal sites will be identified to install the CH4- CO2 sensors. A 2 m X 2 m x 2 m test Cell will be constructed as shown in the fig. 1 to monitor and record the GHG emissions from each of the hotspots (locations where CH4- CO2 emissions are more) at varying depths, on the dump yards on a continuous basis for a year at periodic intervals. A total 100 CH4- CO2 sensors will be installed to collect the GHG emissions.

                                        The output of the study will be a data source of the continuous Green House Gas emissions which are silent killers of the environment. The concentrations of Green House Gases indicated by the sensors will sensitize the authorities to lay laws so as to insist the public to strictly practice the concepts of effective solid waste management at the households. On the whole, the project output would serve as siren in warning the dreadful effects of municipal solid waste to the air environment and would be an information provider giving the potential of wastes that can be converted to energy.
