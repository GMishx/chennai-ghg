                                        On feb 3rd,2014 , a fire was reported at perungudi dumpyard.The week began on an unpleasant note for residents of Thoraipakkam and Velachery as they woke up to the smell of burning garbage at Perungudi dump yard on Monday.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        With the wind carrying the smoke towards Pallikaranai and Velachery, motorists driving along Thoraipakkam Radial Road had to bear with thick smoke in the morning. Fire in the dumping yard is a regular occurrence in the area and complaints of air pollution, breathing difficulty and irritation of eyes are common, a resident said.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Meanwhile, activists are worried about the birds on the Pallikaranai marsh. Jayshree Vencatesan of CareEarth, a Chennai-based biodiversity research organisation, said that there were a total of 133 species of birds in the wetland and there was no research on the impact of the smoke and garbage on the wetlandâ€™s birds.
